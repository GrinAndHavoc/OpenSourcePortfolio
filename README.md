# Open Source Portfolio by Justin Falter
A public, simplified version of my live personal/portfolio website [https://falter.us/](https://falter.us/) created for learning, inspiration, and reuse.

## About
This version removes proprietary assets, replaces real content with placeholders, and includes only the front-end structure and styling from the live site.
